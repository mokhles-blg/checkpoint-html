            trash, but she listens to Tekashi (Damn) Bitch, you lost me (Yeah)
            Fair weather, wishy-washy She thinks Machine washed me (What?) Swear
            to God, man, her favorite rapper wish he'd cross me (Yeah) I love
            conflict, got a obnoxious (What?) subconscious (Yeah) I'm afraid to
            unlock it (Nah) Keep those monsters in the closet I'm what an
            idiotic ('Otic) savant is (Savant is) But I've been throwin' down
            gauntlets since that underground ruckus (Yeah) Where I planted my
            roots (What? Yeah) That's how I had a whole planet that roots for me
            As in the group, and no one thinks dark as I think (Nah) So imagine
            the havoc these black thoughts are to wreak As in Trotter, I keep
            slaughterin' beats Shout out to Beatminerz and T-Minus But, me, long
            as I re-promise to be honest And wholeheartedly, apologies, Rihanna
            For that song that leaked, I'm sorry, Ri It wasn't meant to cause
            you grief Regardless, it was wrong of me, but zeus zeus zeus zeus
            zeus zeus zeus zeus zeus zeus [Chorus: White Gold & Eminem] I be on
            my own (Yeah), head up in the clouds like Zeus When they say, "You
            ain't the GOAT", I come down like, "Who?" But I got my head in the
            clouds like Zeus Where I can see the game from a bird's-eye view,
            ayy Bitch, you talkin' to a rap god, ayy Girl, you talkin' to a
            monsta, ayy You could give your whole damn life to the music thing
            They gon' turn around like they don't love you zeus zeus zeus zeus
            zeus zeus zeus zeus zeus zeus [Verse 2: Eminem] Yeah, they woke a
            giant up So when I get back on my feet, don't wonder why in the Fuck
            is my head in the clouds (Nah) G5 with the stewardess, gettin' head
            in the clouds (Haha) Mile-high club (Why?), I give a flying fuck
            (No) Punchliner just tryin' to survive in this climate of vaginas
            (Bitch) Who dyin' to cancel my ass like Aunt Jemima syrup I'm a
            shit-stirrer, you're a dime-a Dozen, said I couldn't do it Hit
            Europe, kicked the door in, put a foot through it (Ugh) Like a
            stirrup (Stirrup) Used to have to sit and watch them bills pile up
            (Yeah) Now I just sit back and watch them bills pile up (Haha), but

            <a name="Lyrics2"> </a>Hey! Leave me alone (Leave me alone)
            Painic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah Manners missin',
            travel different, no control, yeah Time to listen, time to zip it,
            keep it closed My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
            Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah I'm kinda
            twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost Yeah, see I'm inventive,
            but quite the menace, you ain't know? Well then I'm offended, let's
            jog your memories, here we go, yeah I went from nobody to kinda
            famous Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it My
            wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang
            'em But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
            Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health? Diagnosed with
            OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round That means I
            obsessively obsess on things I think about That means I might take a
            normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
            Ruminating, filled balloons full of doubts Do the same things, if I
            don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone) Thoughts are pacing, they go
            'round and 'round and 'round It's so draining, let's move onto
            something else, fine (Leave me alone) I'm in the game, but they
            don't even know it Like I'm undercover and don't want to blow it I
            come out of nowhere, they don't even notice The flow is so cold, you
            would think it was snowing (Leave me alone) I'm under the weather,
            but wind isn't blowin' I got an umbrella for difficult moments You
            got to admit it, I'm very devoted I'm out in the ring, but they
            don't always help me, so I... Hold up my balloons and cover up my
            face I can feel them weighing on me every day I should let 'em go
            and watch 'em float away But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more
            afraid (More afriad) Tell them how I feel, but they don't want to
            change (They don't wanna change) Tell them how I feel, but they
            remain the same Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay Quiet,
            quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! Ayy, yeah Quiet,
            quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Woo, yeah
            Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! I
            hate when they debate if we're underrated We're so overlooked that
            they're looking over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone) We don't
            do enough interviews or go out in public lately We don't post enough
            on our socials To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone) Let it
            fade, yeah, let it fade Once it's decimated, then you drop a song
            out of nowhere And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone) Then the
            buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation I don't need
            advice from my doubts right now End of conversation (Leave me alone)
            Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth Better tone it down, close it
            now If you make a sound, I'ma change your dial (Leave me alone)
            Funny how they be acting loud, comin' on it now It's floating 'round
            Man, the kid is wild, pretty wild, true (Leave me alone) I'm kinda
            phony but don't really show it I keep it together, but have a
            disorder I go to my room and I sit in my corner And talk to myself
            in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone) I think of a rhyme and
            I have to record it But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the morning
            And question my life again, always avoiding I hate to be different,
            but hate to be normal, so I... (Leave me alone) Hold up my balloons
            and cover up my face I can feel them weighing on me every day I
            should let 'em go and watch 'em float away But I'm scared if I do,
            then I'll be more afraid Tell them how I feel, but they don't want
            to change Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same Loosen up
            my grip, they say that's not okay Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,
            ayy, leave me alone! Ayy, yeah Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,
            ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Woo, yeah Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,
            quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Remember back in "NO NAME, " I
            said fame called? Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Wrong,
            leave me alone) Finally called him back, we didn't talk long He
            asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Wrong, Leave me alone)
            Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off I texted him that
            night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, wrong) It took a
            couple days to get a response But once I finally did, he said this
            song sucks (Leave me alone) Here are the symptoms, couldn't miss
            'em, wrestle with 'em Then I penny flip 'em, bounce 'em back up
            nowhere, you should get some Who you dissin'? Move the switch and
            don't come in the kitchen You should listen, cookin' records for my
            hands are blistering So persistent, don't forget this, hold the
            tension, soul is bending No pretending, open ended, low percentage,
            so demented (Leave me alone) Whole consensus, flow tremendous, no
            apprentice, no incentive Show intensive, so possessive, tone
            aggressive, watch your step when I (Leave me alone) Hold up my
            balloons and cover up my face (Up my face) I can feel them weighing
            on me every day (Yeah, every day) I should let 'em go and watch them
            float away (Yeah, float away) But I'm scared if I do then I'll be
            more afraid Leave me alone (Yeah), leave me alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Leave me alone, leave me alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah) Leave me alone,
            leave me alone (Yeah, leave me alone) Leave me alone, leave me
            alone, ayy, leave me alone! Ayy, yeah Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet,
            quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Woo, yeah Quiet, quiet, quiet,
            quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Ayy, yeah Quiet, quiet,
            quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Yeah), leave me alone! Woo, yeah Quiet,
            quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy (Leave me alone)
